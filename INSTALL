GOsa2.1 QUICK INSTALL
=====================

* Installing GOsa

Unpack the GOsa tarball and move the main gosa directory to
a place your webserver is configured to find it. The default
location will be /usr/share/gosa. For later reference, I assume
that you've choosen this path, too.

Create the directory /var/spool/gosa for the smarty compile directory.
Make it read/write for the webserver (additional chmod 770). You may
want to move it elsewhere, configure it in gosa.conf.

Create the configuration directory /etc/gosa and make sure
that your webserver can read it.

As a summmary, you now have these directories for GOsa:

/etc/gosa
/var/spool/gosa
/usr/share/gosa

After this has been done, include settings for GOsa in your apache
config:

# Set alias to gosa
Alias /gosa /usr/share/gosa/html

Assumed you've installed PHP >= 4.3.10, restart your apache webserver
and do your first GOsa dry run without configuration:

http[s]://your-server/gosa/setup.php

GOsa setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a
basic gosa.conf to save in /etc/gosa. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.


* Migrating an existing tree

To migrate an existing LDAP tree, you've to do all steps from above,
plus some modifications:

- GOsa only shows users that have the objectClass gosaAccount
  This one has been introduced for several reasons. First, there are
  cases you want to hide special accounts from regular admins (i.e.
  a samba admin account which is used to log windows machines into
  their domain, where chaning a password by accident has bad consequences).
  Secondly the gosaAccount keeps the lm/nt password hashes and the
  attributes for the last password change - with the consequence that
  adding a samba account "later" will not require the user to reset
  the password.

- GOsa only recognizes subtrees (or departments in GOsa's view of things)
  that have the objectClass gosaDepartment. You can hide subtrees from GOsa
  by not putting this objectClass inside.

- You need at least one group with objectClass gosaObject and attribute
  gosaSubtreeACL set to :all in the base of your tree. All members of this
  group are able to change everything in GOsa. Look at the cn=administrators
  from above.

That should be all. Entries should be visible in GOsa now. Be aware that if
your naming policy of user cn's differs from the way GOsa handles it, the
entries get rewritten to a GOsa style dn.
