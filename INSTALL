Prequisite:

* You have a system up and running. It has apache and PHP installed
and there is a blank (or prefilled) but working LDAP available.
---

GOsa 2.8.1 INSTALL
================

Recommendations:

* PHP Version 7.4
* OpenLDAP 2.4, 
* To use the two factor authentication `cn=config` must have a password set. This must be identical to the admin password.

Example: set password for `cn=config`

```
# config_pw.ldif

dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
changetype: modify
replace: olcRootPW
olcRootPW: {password}
```
`$ sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f config_pw.ldif`

## Install gosa schema for LDAP:
To successfully complete the installation of GOsa, the gosa schema must be included on the LDAP. In the current versions of OpenLDAP, this no longer needs to happen via ldap.conf.

After the LDAP is configured and ready, the GOsa schema can be included as follows:

```
# install gosa schema
$ sudo apt install gosa-schema

# create convert.conf file
$ sudo vim /etc/ldap/gosa_convert.conf

# add the following lines
# Can be extended for individual scheme. Care must be taken to add dependencies in the correct order.
include /etc/ldap/schema/core.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/cosine.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/nis.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema

include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/samba3.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gofon.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gosystem.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/goto.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gosa-samba3.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/gofax.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/goserver.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/goto-mime.schema
include /etc/ldap/schema/gosa/trust.schema
# save and exit the file

# make temporary slaptest folder and test the conversion of gosa_convert.conf
$ mkdir /tmp/gosa_schema_convert
$ slaptest -f /etc/ldap/gosa_convert.conf -F /tmp/gosa_schema_convert

# copy the converted files to your slapd.d folder and set the permissions
$ sudo cp -p /tmp/gosa_schema_convert/cn\=config/cn\=schema/* /etc/ldap/slapd.d/cn\=config/cn\=schema/
$ sudo chown -R openldap:openldap /etc/ldap/slapd.d/

# restart the service
$ sudo service slapd restart
```

## Installing GOsa 2.8.1 from Repository:

Prequisite:

Create the following folders with the associated permissions
### Main GOsa directory
- /usr/share/gosa (Or the destination folder of your choice)
  - `$ sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/directory`
  - Set alias to GOsa in your apache web-server config file: `Alias /gosa /usr/share/gosa/html`
### Smarty compile directory
- /var/spool/gosa
  - `$ sudo chown www-data /var/spool/gosa && sudo chmod 770 /var/spool/gosa`
### Config directory
- /etc/gosa
  - `$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/gosa`

### Update the class cache
- Run `./update-gosa` from the GOsa main directory. Restart your webserver.
- After successful update start your first GOSA dry run without configuration.
    * http[s]://your-server/gosa

### Go through setup
- The GOsa setup performs some basic system checks on common prerequisites. Optional settings such as bruteforce protection can be set during the process. Finally, a basic configuration (gosa.conf) is provided for download. Follow the instructions
until you are able to log in.

#### You're done. Have Fun.

GOsa 2.6 QUICK INSTALL
======================

Installing GOsa from source:

Unpack the GOsa tarball and move the main gosa directory to
a place your webserver is configured to find it. The default
location will be /usr/share/gosa. For later reference, I assume
that you've choosen this path, too.

Create the directory /var/spool/gosa for the smarty compile directory.
Make it read/write for the webserver (additional chmod 770). You may
want to move it elsewhere, configure it in gosa.conf.

Create the configuration directory /etc/gosa and make sure
that your webserver can read it.

As a summmary, you now have these directories for GOsa:

/etc/gosa
/var/spool/gosa
/usr/share/gosa

Update the class cache:

Run "update-gosa" from the GOsa main directory.

After this has been done, include settings for GOsa in your apache
config:

# Set alias to gosa
Alias /gosa /usr/share/gosa/html

Assumed you've installed PHP >= 5.2.0, reload your apache webserver
and do your first GOsa dry run without configuration:

http[s]://your-server/gosa

GOsa setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a
basic gosa.conf to save in /etc/gosa. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.

You're done. Lets play with the GUI.

* Installing from Packages

If you install GOsa from packages, all the steps from above will
be done automatically. Go to the setup:

http[s]://your-server/gosa

GOsa setup will perform some basic system checks about general
prerequisites. The setup asks some questions and provides a
basic gosa.conf to save in /etc/gosa. Follow the instructions
until you're able to log in.

You're done. Lets play with the GUI.

* Migrating an existing tree

To migrate an existing LDAP tree, you've to do all steps from above,
plus some modifications:

- GOsa only shows users that have the objectClass gosaAccount
  This one has been introduced for several reasons. First, there are
  cases you want to hide special accounts from regular admins (i.e.
  a samba admin account which is used to log windows machines into
  their domain, where chaning a password by accident has bad consequences).
  Secondly the gosaAccount keeps the lm/nt password hashes and the
  attributes for the last password change - with the consequence that
  adding a samba account "later" will not require the user to reset
  the password.

- GOsa only recognizes subtrees (or departments in GOsa's view of things)
  that have the objectClass gosaDepartment. You can hide subtrees from GOsa
  by not putting this objectClass inside.

The GOsa setup may be used to do these migrations, but it is not meant
to work in every possible circumstance. For the first time:

DO NOT WORK ON PRODUCTIVE DATA IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

That should be all. Entries should be visible in GOsa now. Be aware that if
your naming policy of user cn's differs from the way GOsa handles it, the
entries get rewritten to a GOsa style dn.
