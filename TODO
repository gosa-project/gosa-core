  User certificates are only shown as "absent" or "present", because the
  SSL PHP module isn't buildable in the moment. I'll check this later on.
    (Notes:
     openssl x509 -outform DER -in incert.pem  -out outcert.der
     ldif -b "usercertificate;binary" < outcert.der   > cert.ldif
     print_r(openssl_x509_parse ($this->userCertificate));
    )
